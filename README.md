# Hashtable 
 This repo contains the project that involves making a hashmap for information in a table. This hashmap can then be accessed in a user friendly way
 Anyone who has python can just run the script however there is also an exe for the not python windows users (no macs yet sorry)
 I am looking to adjust the project to add the ability use your own files and columns(indexes)
