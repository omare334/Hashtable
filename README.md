# Hashtable 
 This repo contains the project that involves making a hashmap for information in a table. This hashmap can then be accessed in a user friendly way
 Anyone who has python can just run the script however there is also an exe for the not python windows users (no macs yet sorry)
 I am looking to adjust the project to add the ability use your own files and columns(indexes)

How to use :
Add a file which contains your key collumn and the intended output value 
If you want to test the exe you can just have the all_data.csv file in the same folder 
then use the word 'hash' for the first output 
and then the word 'national_insurance_number' for the second output 
then to test use 'other' it is the easiest to test that there is an output 
however if you know your hash numbers then you can use it as normal on any file 
just make sure that the file and exe are in the same folder
